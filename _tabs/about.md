## Hi. I’m Kuibin Lin. Nice to meet you!

I’m not exactly sure when or why it happened, but at some point, I realised it would be useful to have a basic understanding of programming. Back at university, I always wanted to take a programming module, but it never worked out with my schedule. So, I never got the chance to properly study it.

After I started working, I took a short course on data science with Python. My learning’s been a bit on and off since then, but my curiosity about programming and computer hardware has never gone away.

With bootcamps and courses being quite pricey, I decided to teach myself using online resources like YouTube, Coursera, and Udemy. Ever since ChatGPT came onto the scene, learning new skills has become so much simpler. By combining online tutorials with ChatGPT's guidance, I’ve explored a wide range of projects—building PCs, working with Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jekyll, GitHub Pages, Raspberry Pi, Cloudflare DNS, WireGuard, Docker, Nginx, Proxmox, TrueNAS, OpenWRT, Azure Cloud, and more.

I initially started this blog as a way to learn Jekyll and GitHub Pages, but it’s grown into a space where I document my learning journey and share what I’ve discovered. Below, you’ll find a list of [tools](/tags) or you can browse the [categories](/categories) I’ve been exploring. You can also find my contact details in the sidebar should you wish to get in touch.
